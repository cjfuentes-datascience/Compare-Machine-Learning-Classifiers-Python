# Compare-Machine-Learning-Classifiers-Python

This project demonstrates how to compare the performance of several machine learning classifiers in Python using the scikit-learn package. A synthetic classification dataset is generated and 14 different machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on the dataset. The performance of the models is then evaluated and compared to determine which algorithm performs best on the given dataset. 

This project provides a useful guide for selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given classification problem and the scikit-learn library makes it easy to test multiple algorithms quickly.
